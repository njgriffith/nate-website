        <h2>10-04-2024: Current hobbies & the worst movie ever made</h2>
        <h3>Missed in the last post</h3>
        I completely forgot to mention that I've had a couple chess phases but I never got super serious about it. I
        think I was like 1550ish rapid. Also I taught myself Mandarin for like a year, I was ok and could maybe get
        around in China if I had to, but I stopped cause I never really found a use for it. I'd be happy to pick it
        up again if I ever met someone fluent that I spent a lot of time with.<br><br>
        <h3>Pole vaulting</h3>
        I went to my first session a couple months ago and I've been really enjoying it. I haven't pursued a new
        sport in a while and for whatever reason this one feels right. On top of how much fun jumping is, it feels
        great to exercise with a purpose. Like now when I work out I'm going stuff to help my jumps which is nice
        cause I get to reap the rewards of my efforts by jumping higher! So that's been a lot of fun and the coach
        is great which helps a lot. He's super encouraging and has a lot of faith in me which makes me even more
        motivated. After writing this I'm going to Lowe's to get a pvc pipe for practice.<br><br>
        Now I know it's probably kinda cringe to have a little paragraph about vaulting and then a much larger
        paragraph about a video game, but ummmmm…. uhhhhhh… <br>Celeste is a very difficult and precise
        platformer, and I'm gonna give you some introduction to set the stage for this challenge I'm working on.
        So the main story of Celeste has 7 levels of increasing difficulty, and they're honestly not too bad.
        It'll be a struggle but pretty much anyone could get through these eventually. I think I spent about 8
        hours of play time on them. Upon completing the story there's an additional level 8 that gets a bit
        harder than the final level of the main story. But here's where things get interesting. Each level has a
        hidden casette tape that, if you find it, unlocks a "B-side" for that level. B sides are usually
        slightly shorter, but have a huuuge increase in difficulty. Manage to beat all of those, and you unlock
        "C-sides". C sides are very short, only having 3 rooms to complete, but they will be the most difficult
        screens in the game. So now that you understand the difficulty curve of the game and its 24 levels (8
        a-sides, b-sides, and c-sides), I can explain the 202 strawberry challenge.
        <br><br>There are 202 strawberries you can collect in the game. 175 are simple, just hidden somewhere in
        the a-sides, but usually not too hard to get, som I'm done with those. So that leaves 27, and these are
        the ones worth talking about. Once you've finish <strong>all</strong> the c-sides, a golden strawberry
        will appear at the start of each level. If you pick it up and finish the entire level without dying,
        congrats! You got a golden strawberry. Easier said than done of course since some of these levels
        regularly have people dying close to 1000 times before their first clear. So do that once for every a,
        b, and c-side, and you're at 199/202.
        <br><br>So what are the last 3 then? First one is pretty straightforward, beat the first level without
        dashing. This however requires a lot of pixel perfect jumps since you can use the most important
        mechanic in the game.
        Now, to introduce the last 2 berries, I have to talk about the actual final chapter, Farewell. <br><br>
        Chapter 9, or "Farewell", is far and away the longest and most difficult map in the game. It's actually
        not even close. There's no b or c side, just chapter 9. It features screens that regularly are at and
        even exceeding the difficulty of the hardest c side screens. But instead of 3 rooms, it's 93 *thunder
        crashing* There's one hidden berry where you complete the entire final screen of Farewell (which is by
        far the longest screen) and at the very end instead of finishing it, you have to traverse backwards and
        to a secret room that's about as hard as they get in the game. Complete that and the moon berry is
        yours. And of course, the final berry, strawberry #202... the Farewell golden. If you somehow get to
        this point, you have a task before you that will make all your previous achievements feel vanishingly
        insignificant in comparison. Complete all of Farewell without dying once, and the last berry is yours. I
        died over 3000 times completing Farewell the first time, so if I get there it'll be a while before I can
        shave that number down. Here's a table of the challenge berries I have so far:<br><br>

        <br>
        So the c-sides are obviously really hard but they're super short so easier to golden that even the a-sides
        sometimes.

        <h3>The worst movie of all time</h3>
        Ok last thing. If you are at all interested in witnessing cinema <strong>history(!!!)</strong>, you have to
        have to have to go see Megalopolis. This movie has completely changes my brain, in fact it's probably still
        happening. I have no idea what I witnessed the other night, and can't make sense of it. Like you might say a
        movie is bad cause it's boring but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I pissed in the seat! I
        was cracking up pretty much the whole time, and when I woke up the next day, I didn't even believe it was
        real. It was so bizarre that I thought I dreamt it, until I realized that no dream I could have would ever
        be as feverish, confusing, and surreal as a single scene from Megalopolis.<br><br>Yes, it did suck
        Megacockolis, but it was one of the most memorable movie experiences of my life. It is ambitiously bad. It's
        worse than any other movie could ever dare to be.
