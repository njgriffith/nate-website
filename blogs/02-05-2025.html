            So a little bit ago I realized that some of my reviews are pretty mid at best.
            There are some that I put a lot of time into really squeezing the essence of what made them click for me,
            and some others that I think I
            just wanted to get through to check off one of the many albums I had slated for review.

            <br><br>To be honest, writing a good review, or at least writing one that I'm happy with takes a lot of
            mental energy. You have to be totally focused on immersing yourself in the universe of the sound. You can't
            just <em>ohhh yeah, i liked it a lot, it was awesome!!!</em>. That isn't interesting. You have to close you
            eyes, hit play, and when you open
            them you have to describe as best you can the new world you're in. Does it feel cold? Cold like what? A
            refreshing cold like water splashing on your face? Or a paralyzing cold like being stranded high on a
            mountain and you can see the Sun setting as storm clouds roll in? Or maybe it's cold like the feeling that
            you don't have a place where you belong? Whatever the case may be appealing to some relatable, tangible,
            read-world sense through whatever metaphors you can reach is really the only way to describe something as
            nebulous as music.

            <br><br>Cause music really is a world of its own. Someone could tell you what it looked like on
            top of Mt. Everest. They could even show you a 4k, 360 degree photograph on a clear sunny day at the summit.
            But the only way you can truly capture the feeling is to be <em>there. </em>So all my lazy reviews where I
            just say something is good, or catchy, or any other nondescript sentence that anyone could say about
            anything they like. They are gonna get a 2nd look.

            <br><br>
            And not to say that I just want these reviews
            to be interesting to other people, I mean of course I do to some extent, but I really just want them to be
            interesting to me. The reviews I spent a lot of time and effort on turned into extremely rewarding and
            cathartic listening experiences. They made me appreciate the albums and by extension, art, so much more.

            <br><br>
            Also I might add a button in the album reviews app that shows upcoming reviews I have slated, but either way
            stay tuned
