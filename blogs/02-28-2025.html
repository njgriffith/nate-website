            On Friday February 21st, at around 9:30pm, my dog Rocky died. It still doesn't feel real. I know it
            happened, but something in my head won't accept that I'll never see him again. That I'll never get to pet
            him, give him treats, or take him for walks again. It was only yesterday that I cleaned the tissues from
            next to my bed. I don't think I've ever felt so crippled. I canceled plans, called off work, I couldn't sit
            still, I could hardly stand. I remember driving
            home and getting light headed, when I got out of my car I could barely stand, and when I got inside I
            collapsed for about an hour. It just felt so wrong that I walked into a room with him for the last time and
            walked out without him. Wrong like it was my fault or something, like there was something I could've done
            that would've made him still be here. I hate that I turned the other way when I left the room instead of
            taking one more look at him. I hate that I could still smell him on my hands, and I just wished more than
            anything that I wouldn't be going home alone.
            <br><br>
            I've dealt with death before. I've had blood relatives pass in my life, but nothing has ever felt like this.
            I felt like a piece of me died. Rocky was around for pretty much everything that ever happened in my life. I
            grew up with him. He used to pull me on my roller blades down the street. I would go to the art museum every
            day with him and throw sticks in the creek for him. We would race home and I'd give him treats. When he was
            little he loves chasing pinecones I kicked on the sidewalk. He used to be able to fit under the porch and
            would nap there on hot days. I hate the feeling of remembering all these things and that one memory I'll
            never forget is what it felt like to watch him go to sleep for the last time.
            <br><br>
            I loved him so much, and so did everyone who ever met him. I know he had a great life, and I'm forever
            grateful that we did so much to make that happen. He walked for an hour and a half every day of his life
            until he got too old. We went to every park, forest, or patch of green we could find. He swam in the
            ocean, climbed mountains, jumped in lakes, chased horses, got chased back, and he loved every bit of it.
            I am thankful for him, and I'm so happy I was lucky enough to have him in my life.
            <br><br>
            I think it may be true that everything in life balances out in the end. Rocky gave me an abundance of
            happiness in my life, every day for 13 and a half years. And now his generous loan has left me with
            crippling debt I'm paying back. It hurts so much, but I'm so thankful that I could now what it means to be loved this much. I hope there's lots of squirrels in dog heaven.
            <br><br>I love you and I will never forget you, Rocky.<br><br>
