    <h2>Being a Hater</h2>
    <p>
        Being a hater is something I've been thinking more about recently since I've been writing a lot of music
        reviews. In this blog I'll be writing about criticism of taste, mostly referencing music since I've written a
        decent bit about that on here, but the ideas are pretty broadly applicable to other forms of art. I want to talk
        about why, in my opinion, being a hater can actually be a good thing, and how "It's not that deep"
        and "Why can't you just let people enjoy things", while occasionally valid, typically just undermine honest
        critique. Sometimes it <strong><i>is</i></strong> that deep, and sometimes people <strong><i>should</i></strong>
        ask themselves
        <br><u>
            <h3>Do I actually like this?</h3>
        </u>
        I think the most common reason people hate on criticism/critics, is when it's challenging something they
        personally enjoy. And while I agree that it sucks to hear something that you connect with be dragged
        through the mud, challenging ideas is important to the preservation of intellectualism. I know that sounds
        insanely dramatic, but I think there's a slippery slope from not acknowledging legitimate criticism of your
        personal taste, be that music, movies, books, etc., to not acknowledging criticism to any facet of your belief
        system. Think about all the people that will die on the hill of rationalizing everything Kanye
        says, defending the artistic merit of everything he releases, all because they've already solidified this image
        of him in their head. "He made graduation!". Do you think that same person would be willing to hear you out on
        "why X rapper is better than Kanye"? Do you think they'd hear you out
        How you do anything is how you do everything. Can't listen to someone shit on your favorite music? Probably
        aren't willing to seek, or even harbor, information that challenges your world view.
        <br><br>If one person criticizing your favorite artist/album/song/genre ever really does so much damage to you,
        maybe you should
        explore why you actually enjoy it.<br><br>Who knows, maybe they're right, maybe it's shit. Maybe it's so shit
        but you never even took the time to explore other things because you were comfortable staying in a bubble. Maybe
        this will be the spark that gets you to explore new music, find something you have a deeper connection with than
        you ever realized was possible. Maybe you'll find things that make you feel emotions you've never experienced.
        Maybe you'll become obsessed and fall in love with an artist/genre that would've otherwise never heard of, or...
        <br><br>Who knows, maybe they're wrong, maybe it's amazing. Maybe it's so amazing that as you revisit it you
        find yourself peeling back more and more layers, discovering new sounds or meaning that you hadn't even though
        of before. Maybe you even feel like you have the ammunition critique the critique of your favorite music. In
        doing so, you fall in love with it all over again, fortifying your admiration for a work of art.
        <br><br>Neither of these outcomes are possible unless you welcome and evaluate criticism honestly.
