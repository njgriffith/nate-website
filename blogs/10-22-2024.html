            So after vaulting for like a 1.5/2 months I have my first meet coming up. Honestly I wasn't sure if they let
            people
            outside of school into these meets but there's events for people way older than me. There were 2 60
            year-olds at my
            last practice, so thankfully it's not just me vs. the high schoolers.
            <br><br>I have a problem though, I'm about a week and a half away and I still haven't figured out one of the
            most
            important parts of the jump. Let me break it down for you.
            <br><br>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="https://media.tenor.com/kVlfgrVr4O8AAAAM/breakdance-break.gif">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            Ok but actually, there's basically 3 parts to the jump, it's a lot more complicated than I'll make it sound,
            but for
            simplicities sake there's just 3 parts.
            <ol>
                <li>plant</li>
                <li>swing</li>
                <li>turn</li>
            </ol>
            A good plant looks something like this. You get as much speed as you possibly can in the run-up and jump as
            high as
            you can and press your arms up as hard as you can to put all the energy you got from the sprint and jump
            into the
            pole so it can bend. The more the pole bends, the higher it can fling you. So being fast, being able to jump
            high
            are pretty key here. Good sprinters/long-jumpers usually have good plants. "As ___ as you can" is a common
            theme in
            the jump, it's pretty much a full exertion for like 5-10 seconds.

            <br><br>
            Next step is the swing, so in the pic above the guy is gonna swing leading with his driving leg (right leg)
            until he
            gets completely upside-down. That's basically it. You want the start to finish of the swing to be as fast as
            possible to shift all your momentum upwards. People that do calisthenics/gymnasts are good at this part.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            So I can kinda do those parts, it doesn't look as good as the pics obviously, but hey, it gets the job done
            enough
            for now. The part I can't do is the turn. At the peak of your swing you gotta turn yourself around so you
            can go
            over the bar with your stomach facing the ground.<br><br>

            Easier said than done, at least for me. I just get super disoriented when I'm up at the top. Having to flip
            from
            forward to backward and upside-down to rightside-up at the same time messes with my head. I just drop the
            pole and
            fall on my butt pretty much, but I've been working on some drills at home for this.
            <br><br>Anyways, I've got a week and half to get it down, godspeed Nate.
