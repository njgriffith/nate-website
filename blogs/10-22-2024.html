        <h2>Vault meet on Nov. 1st</h2>
        So after vaulting for like a 1.5/2 months I have my first meet coming up. Honestly I wasn't sure if they let people
        outside of school into these meets but there's events for people way older than me. There were 2 60 year-olds at my
        last practice, so thankfully it's not just me vs. the high schoolers.
        <br><br>I have a problem though, I'm about a week and a half away and I still haven't figured out one of the most
        important parts of the jump. Let me break it down for you.
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="https://media.tenor.com/kVlfgrVr4O8AAAAM/breakdance-break.gif">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Ok but actually, there's basically 3 parts to the jump, it's a lot more complicated than I'll make it sound, but for
        simplicities sake there's just 3 parts.
        <ol>
            <li>plant</li>
            <li>swing</li>
            <li>turn</li>
        </ol>
        A good plant looks something like this. You get as much speed as you possibly can in the run-up and jump as high as
        you can and press your arms up as hard as you can to put all the energy you got from the sprint and jump into the
        pole so it can bend. The more the pole bends, the higher it can fling you. So being fast, being able to jump high
        are pretty key here. Good sprinters/long-jumpers usually have good plants. "As ___ as you can" is a common theme in
        the jump, it's pretty much a full exertion for like 5-10 seconds.
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img
                src="https://external-preview.redd.it/esN0eiFKmStSegAXnhVhk5_BL9DbmAYK5HfUuhHzr_o.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c6a82557b260346f7c1fb41e54e80d8142f19902">

        <br><br>
        Next step is the swing, so in the pic above the guy is gonna swing leading with his driving leg (right leg) until he
        gets completely upside-down. That's basically it. You want the start to finish of the swing to be as fast as
        possible to shift all your momentum upwards. People that do calisthenics/gymnasts are good at this part.
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>
        <br><br>
        So I can kinda do those parts, it doesn't look as good as the pics obviously, but hey, it gets the job done enough
        for now. The part I can't do is the turn. At the peak of your swing you gotta turn yourself around so you can go
        over the bar with your stomach facing the ground.<br><br>
        <div class="img-container">

        Easier said than done, at least for me. I just get super disoriented when I'm up at the top. Having to flip from
        forward to backward and upside-down to rightside-up at the same time messes with my head. I just drop the pole and
        fall on my butt pretty much, but I've been working on some drills at home for this.
        <br><br>Anyways, I've got a week and half to get it down, godspeed Nate.
