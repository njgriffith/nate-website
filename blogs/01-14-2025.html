    <h2>01-14-2025: biking places and cold weather</h2>

    <div style="font-size: 1.5em;">
        Sometimes, I like to bike places if I can. The roads around where I live aren't super safe for it, but if
        there's a decently car free or trail-able way to get there I like to give it a shot.
        I also like going for runs, rides, or just to walk around in the cold, or the rain, or the cold and rain. Other
        people tell me that rainy weather drains them of energy but I've always felt the opposite. I have my most energy
        when the weather cold, dreary, or rainy. Thats not to say I don't appreciate a hot summer day, or just a warm
        spring day in the sun with a breeze, but something about these kinds of days scratch a certain itch I have.
        <br><br>
        I also don't know if part of me, because my life is pretty easy, want's something strenuous to trudge through to
        make it feel like I actually "worked for my meal". Like if I walk somewhere for 30 mins in the cold rain, once I
        get inside I feel like I activate the same part of my brain as a caveman who finally got to sit down next to his
        cave fire after a long day of fighting tigers. And because that mart of my brain never gets it's exercise, I
        feel like it enjoys coming out of the box every now and then.
        <br><br>
        I remember one time I had to get star anise and a couple other things for a recipe on a weekend day. I knew
        there was supposed to be a tropical storm coming through but I decided to go anyways figuring I'd be hit with
        some rain, no big deal. Well...during that 16 mile bike ride I got pelted...utterly soaked and damn near blown
        to a halt at times. But when I got home and threw my sopping wet clothes in the bath and got clean and dry, I
        felt like it was of the best, most memorable bike rides I'd ever been on.
        Now admittedly this was totally stupid. Like 3 large pine trees in my path fell over during the ride. It wasn't
        a fun little drizzle anymore it was a read deal storm.
        <br><br>
        And part of me thinks that this is just how I enjoy nature. It feels real, and because of that it feels
        immersive,
        it feels special. If I only ever went outside on a sunny 70 degree refreshing gust of wind lemonade drinking ice
        cream eating "canonbaalllllll" ass day, it would be inauthentic, contrived. I like to feed my caveman lizard
        brain. I went on a hike in Oregon in September up and around Mt. Hood. Me and my brother walked all day every
        day, and when we would get to a good looking spot to pitch the tent by some water, I'd drop my stuff and sit
        down barefoot by the river and eat sardines out of a tin. This made caveman Nate feel very happy.

        <h3>In other news</h3>
        It's January and I'm back on the pole vaulting grind baby!! I haven't been able to do it consistently cause of
        being sick or travel or the holidays or whatever else, but now I'm back and I'm jumin'.
        <br><br>I'm eyeing an event on Feb. 7th rn, we'll see if I feel ready. My turn is still a work in progress which
        sucks but everything else is looking a lot better. I know if I just keep putting in work it'll have to come to
        me at some point, and once everything comes together I think it'll be awesome.
        <br><br>
        The goal for the season is still 12 feet, and you'll hear from me when I get it. Or you might be hearing from
        the local fire department after they get called TO PULL <strong>ME</strong> OUT OF THE FUCKING
        <strong>ROOF!!</strong><br><br>gn
