    <h2>First meet</h2>
    <p>
        The first pole vault meet of the season (and my life) was last Friday. I wasn't able to figure out the turn in
        time so I had to go over the back on my back which severely limits how high you can jump. Correct form is like
        this:
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="https://www.sportphotogallery.com/content/images/cmsfiles/product/44788/45783-zoom.jpg">
    </div>
    <br>
    So I don't get that extra height from arcing my body, I just hit the bar with my ass instead.

    But overall it was really successful, and now at the very least I have a number to beat. So I wanted to make a
    little graphic to put in perspective the height I jumped compared to other jumpers and some random
    things.<br><br>

    Next meet is the one after I get the turn down so hopefully not too long.<br><br>
    Also it was just Halloween and we wanted to watch a horror movie and we settled on one called "Suspiria" from like
    1970-something. Can't recommend it enough. There were moments in the 2nd half where I feel like they lost the
    thread, but some of the scenes in that movie I don't think I'll ever forget because of how good they were. It felt
    like my eyelids had been removed the way I couldn't look away. The soundtrack alone is worth listening to, and it fits so perfectly.
