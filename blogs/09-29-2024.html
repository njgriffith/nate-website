        <h2>09-30-2024: First blog</h2>
    
        <p>Originally this page was supposed to function as a "leaderboard" where I would publish a bunch of records
            for
            different things I've tried, but I realized that a lot of the things that I've put a lot of time into
            don't really translate to a leaderboard.
            I also wanted to talk about whatever I was currently working on in a longer format so I figured a blog
            would be the best way to accomplish this.
            <br><br>So this first blog is basically gonna be an in memorium/reflection of the different endeavors
            I've had in approximately chronological order. Each section is gonna be labeled so you can just skip to
            the ones you're interested in.
            <br><br>
        <h3>Tennis (this is the long one)</h3>
        I mean I did a bunch of different things when I was younger, but tennis is the first one that I'll "count"
        since I was still playing a lot into adulthood.
        Like I played violin for about 7 years but I was never super into it and I quit when I was like 13.<br><br>
        I started playing tennis when I was like 8, and started playing competitively when I was 10, traveling to
        tournaments. There's a lot I could talk about when it comes to playing tennis as a junior, but that's
        honestly pretty boring if you didn't do the same, so I'll just skip to when I was 18.
        <br><br>After I graduated high school I realized that I had a shot at going D1 if I really grinded tennis in
        the summer, so I started training at Raleigh Racquet Club M-F. We would play from 9am-11am, then from
        12:30-3:30pm, then I would coach from 4-6pm. I was so insanely exhausted at the end of each day since we
        were always playing in the heat of the summer, outdoors, on hard courts that get 10-15 degrees warmer than
        the forecasted temp.
        This was brutal, but at the end of it all worth it because I was able to walk on a D1 team at UNC Charlotte,
        and although I was the worst player, I was in the best shape on the team because of all the work I did that
        summer.
        <br><br>
        College was clearly gonna be an uphill battle. I went in a solid tier below the next worse person on the
        team. That's not a huge knock against me either. If I walked into pretty much any country club in the
        country I'd likely be the best/close to the best there, but 2 of the 12 people on my team were literal
        professionals, so college is a whole 'nother league.
        Regardless, I was determined to make the most of the fact that I was lucky to even be there, I looked up to
        a lot of guys on the team and I wanted to be as good as them and really earn my place.
        <br><br>So I basically just got my grindset on and was working around the clock to get better. It didn't
        help that I was an engineering major (everyone else on the team was a business major and way less busy).
        Here's a schedule I remember from first semester freshman year.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>5am wake up and get breakfast</li>
            <li>6 - 7:30am gym</li>
            <li>8 - 11am chem lab</li>
            <li>11:15 - 12:15pm chem class</li>
            <li>cram lunch</li>
            <li>1:30 - 5:15pm practice</li>
            <li>5:30-6:45pm drift in and out of consciousness in the back of calc</li>
        </ul>
        And only then can I even start on any homework or required community activities by student athletes. But I
        knew my hard work was paying off cause I was getting in even better shape and improving the whole time. In
        fact I was getting better <em><strong>faster</strong></em> each month. I was going to tournaments and having
        better results each time, beating better players and even won a tournament. Towards the end of the semester
        I even started taking set off of some of the guys on the team.
        I was even practicing some on Sunday (our day off) to try to get one step closer to the rest of the team. My
        confidence, ability, and enjoyment for the sport were on the up and up and I was super optimistic about my
        future.
        <br><br>I had, however, been dealing with a nagging hip and back pain for a few years now and finally got
        some MRIs done. In late January of my next semester, I got results back from the doctor that told my I
        needed to stop playing immediately in preparation for surgery. In fact, he said he didn't even know how I
        had been playing up to that point with such a badly damaged hip. So that earned me some brownie points with
        the coaches since they thought I was super tough, but that still meant all my progress was gonna be halted.
        At the time, this didn't seem like that huge of a deal to me. It affirmed that the pain I felt was real, and
        I figured I'd be back and better than ever after my recovery.
        <br><br>If you've ever gotten surgery or have a more functional brain than me you probably realized that
        this is a bit too optimistic. After an 8 month recovery, I came back to playing and was struggling heavily.
        I mean the technique never left, but something mentally wasn't there. I had spent such an incredible effort
        gaining so much momentum in my freshman year that I was getting increasingly discouraged that it all went
        out the window. All my 14 hour days, 7 day training weeks, skipping parties with friends, all gone to waste.
        I was struggling to feel like I belonged before, and now I was completely lost.
        I ruminated on my position, which only made my mental worse, which made the ruminating worse and so on. This
        was having a terrible effect on my tennis and rather than improving, I felt my level actively slipping. We
        had an odd number of players so I found myself hitting serves alone during practice or practicing with the
        team's racket stringer. This also came at the same time new coaches took over the program and they really
        had no clue about my situation or how much progress I was making before. It was years later that I had the
        idea that they were likely trying to get me to leave the team so they didn't have to deal with kicking me
        off. I was so incredibly proud of myself at one point, and now felt like I had failed tremendously.
        <br><br>When I finally thought about quitting it was such an easy decision. Like, of course I should quit. I
        was (not clinically) depressed all the time because my confidence was shot from failing harder each and
        every day. I'm skipping over details for the sake of brevity (look how that turned out), but all in all it
        was an amazing decision that allowed me the time and energy to explore all of the following hobbies and
        spend more time with people important to me. I also recognize that through struggle I was able to learn a
        tremendous amount about myself and how I best deal with adversity. I don't have a single regret from my
        entire time playing tennis in college.
        <h3>Running</h3>
        Something active felt like the logical next step, after I spent a lot more time rehabbing my hip and getting
        my strength back up. Running always felt incredibly relaxing, and gave me an opportunity to spend more time
        in nature. This was hardly ever a hobby that I took super seriously, I had a few 3 months stints where I'd
        run pretty heavily but I'd always get burnt out.
        I always found my joy in running through it's spontaneity and feeling of freedom, especially when I was
        trail running. If I hard schedule a training plan its now no longer either of those things.
        In 2023 I decided to turn one of my 3 month stints into training for a half marathon race where I got 9th
        with a time of 1:39:45 and haven't really run at all since then lol.
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        After I stopped playing tennis I thought I'd like learning to code and ended up being really liking it so I
        switch to comp-sci for my major and now it's my job. I used to do coding competitions on codeforces.com but
        didn't do a ton and stopped doing a bunch of harder problems for practice after I got a job. Still like it a
        lot hence this website.
        <h3>Music/Movies/Books</h3>
        I think in like late 2017 I thought that I'd feel more cultured or something if I started listening to
        albums instead of just songs. And I wanted to listen to a lot of interesting and out-there stuff, so I
        started looking around online and since then I've listened to and rated several hundred albums.
        The majority of those were in the 3 years that followed but I still like to hear new stuff when it floats my
        way, I just seek it out less ambitiously than before. I have a music reviews section on this site you
        might've seen, and I plan on adding a review of all my 9/10 and 10/10 albums there, which at the moment is
        about 50 or maybe 8ish% of the albums I've heard.
        <br><br>I also had a similar thought about books last year. I thought "how many great stories am I missing
        out on? wouldn't I feel a sense of satisfaction of experiencing the classics of another form of media?"
        Movies are another thing that I feel like I'll never run out of suggestions for, there's just always
        something you hear about that sounds worth watching.
        <br><br>I guess the summary of this section is that experiencing the great stories of the world and being
        culturally in tune is something that's important to me. And hearing what resonates with others is always
        really interesting to me too cause I think it reflects a lot about how they see themselves.
        <h3>Melee</h3>
        Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Gamecube is one of the greatest games to ever grace the collective
        fingertips of this Earth. The sheer level of passion the community has for the game may be unrivaled.
        Whenever I meet someone that's also into it, we can instantly talk for hours about it.
        I used to play tournaments for a short period of time, but stopped for interest in other things. I also
        wasn't super in to the competitive gamer grind. I'm still an avid spectator and have been since 2016.
        <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
        I had like a couple months where I climbed once a week, but I pretty much stopped cold turkey. It's fun, and
        I'd happily go again, memberships are just expensive and I didn't feel into it enough. I think I climbed a
        few V3s but that was it.
        <h3>Piano</h3>
        I don't even think this lasted 3 days lol.
        <h3>Hollow Knight</h3>
        Hollow Knight is a beautiful single player game and I recommend it if you like difficult games, or even if
        you're on the fence. The worldbuilding, storyline, music and art are all top tier.
        Anyways I played this game a good bit last year and this year too. At the end of the game, there are these
        challenges called pantheons that are basically boss rushes for a bunch of bosses in the game. There are 4 of
        them that get progressively harder.
        If you beat all 4 you unlock a secret 5th pantheon. This one blows the others out of the water. It's all 4
        of the other pantheons combined into 1 plus harder stages/variants for most bosses plus extra bosses in
        general plus at the end of all of it you have to fight a new harder version of what is essentially the
        incarnation of THE SUN, which is far and away the hardest boss in the game. If you beat all (44?) of them in
        a row you complete the hardest achievement in the game. There's also some achievements for speedrunning and
        beating everything without dying (steel soul).
        <br><br>But we can go further...<br>
        The place with the pantheons has this area called "The Hall of Gods" where you can fight every boss
        individually, and if you beat them without getting hit you get a gold symbol next to the bosses name that
        indicates you beat it on "radiant difficulty". So I grinded that and eventually got all 44 of them.
        <br><br>But we can go even further...<br>
        Back to the pantheons. Each one has 4 different bindings you can add to increase difficulty.
        <ul>
            <li>Nail binding: melee damage goes from like 30 to 13</li>
            <li>Soul binding: total soul reserves (for healing and casting spells that do damage) go from 200 to 33
            </li>
            <li>Charm binding: there are 40 charms that can give you various buffs, you can't use those anymore with
                this one</li>
            <li>Mask binding: total health goes from 9 to 4</li>
        </ul>
        Each time you complete one of these, a seal with the binding logo appears above the specific pantheon you
        beat with whatever binding(s) were on. If you can beat all 5 pantheons with each binding on at least once,
        you get a secret room unlock and little bit of extra lore. And I completed this some time earlier this year.
        <br><br>But we can go further yet again...(last time I promise)<br>
        <strong>IF</strong> you managed to do all of that, there is one last challenge the game has for those truly
        brave. You can attempt to beat each pantheon with <strong>all bindings on at the same time!</strong>
        I was only able to do this for the first 2 before I tapped out bit I may revisit one day.
        <h3>Pole Vaulting & Celeste</h3>
        These are my newest hobbies! And since they're current, they deserve their own post after this one, so stay
        tuned.
