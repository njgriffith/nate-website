            It is the big TWO-ZERO-TWO-FIVE and I'll be damned if it isn't well past due for me to get my screen time
            down.Fight now I'm anywhere between 5 hrs a day to 8.5 hours a day according to the settings app. So over
            the rest of this month (and likely/hopefully afterwards) I'll be golfing with my screen time. Low score
            wins.

        <div class="sub-header">I will get more done.</div>
        <div class="blog-body">
            It's documented that if a person has a task they don't want to do, but you lock them in a room with just
            that task, they <em>will</em> do it. Boredom is so strongly avoided by our brain chemistry that would
            would rather suffer than be bored. Now suffering is probably a strong word for taking out the recycle
            but how else am I gonna convince myself that I'm the hero of this story? I'll try to keep a mental note of
            some tasks I get done due to my extra time.

        <div class="sub-header">I will have more energy.</div>
        <div class="blog-body">
            Using your phone before bed messes with sleep, everyone knows this. Getting good sleep is so central to
            pretty much everything in life, so I'm expecting big outcomes from this. But there is another aspect of this
            that I expect to boost energy. And what follows is my own bro science so if it doesn't make sense to you
            just know that it was fact checked by a <b>real</b> American <b>patriot</b> and not some pencil-neck liberal
            scientist.<br><br>
            I think that throughout the day, we are best serving our mind and the task at hand if our focus is solely
            dedicated to said task. Cleaning the dishes should be <em>just</em> cleaning the dishes, not cleaning the
            dishes with a youtube video in the background. Watching a show should be <em>just</em> watching a show, not
            watching a show while scrolling reddit, a good show/movie deserves your full attention, if it truly can't
            keep it then it's probably not a good show.<br><br>

            Furthermore, when it's actually time for me to rest I'm gonna be resting fully. Currently I just lay down
            and go in my phone which rests my body but not my mind which I think is something I overlooked hard in the
            past. I'm hoping entering periods of "true rest" will let me feel more energetic when I need to be.

            So that's the plan for now. Will give updates/thoughts in about a month.
