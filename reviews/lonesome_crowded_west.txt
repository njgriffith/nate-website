Modest Mouse - The Lonesome Crowded West

This is pretty much Modest Mouse in full force showing how good 90s indie rock can be.
The album bounces back and forth between bringing the house down and showing off that expansive lonely sound they made their own on their debut album which
I take as a reflection of the way they feel about the place the grew up (west coast United States).
The early career of MM was defined by them bottling and selling the feeling of being directionless in your 20s and this album delivers that 
sentiment in an extaordinarily and uniquely cathartic way.
