Xiu Xiu - Girl With Basket of Fruit

Of all albums I have given a perfect score, this one is the one I listen to least by a longshot.
I mean it's good... right? I can't listen to it without getting naseuous and needing a shower after, but I think it's perfect?
I say this all not to question my actual feelings about this album, but rather to express how disguistingly offputting this album can be.
I'd say if you if you some kind of nagging morbid curiosity, or maybe always wondered what it would feel like if you could microdose paranoid schizophrenia, give this album a try. 
But don't blame me for how you feel afterwards.
There is absolutely no time to get comfortable with this album, you never get a chance to get a good look at your surroundings, never can quite find your footing before the rug is pulled out from under you again.
Trying to predict where this album will go and when it will stop is next to impossible.
And when you finally get to the final track, the only somewhat normal one, you have time to take in all the carnage you just witnessed.
This soft ballad closer juxtaposed against the rest of the album feels evokes something akin to the image of a couple slowdancing in a room full of gore and human waste.
Pretty much every song on here triggers my fight or flight, especially Mary Turner.
I feel like it's the same part of your brain that couldn't look away from a brutal car crash on the side of the road.
This is more terrifying, chill inducing, and sadistic than any horror movie I've ever seen.
