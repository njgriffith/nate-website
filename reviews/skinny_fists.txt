Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven

There is probably no music that I know of that better encapsulates the feeling a being a human. What it means to live, grow, fail, learn, love, hate, decay, die, and everything in-between.
To short, if I had to show aliens one thing to help them understand what it meant to be human, I would choose this.
There is probably much more that can be said about this, but I'd rather just let the album speak for itself.
This is the only time I think I've ever given album a perfect score on first listen.
