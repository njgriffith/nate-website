            <h2>10-04-2024: Current hobbies & the worst movie ever made</h2>
            <h3>Missed in the last post</h3>
            I completely forgot to mention that I've had a couple chess phases but I never got super serious about it. I
            think I was like 1550ish rapid. Also I taught myself Mandarin for like a year, I was ok and could maybe get
            around in China if I had to, but I stopped cause I never really found a use for it. I'd be happy to pick it
            up again if I ever met someone fluent that I spent a lot of time with.<br><br>
            <h3>Pole vaulting</h3>
            I went to my first session a couple months ago and I've been really enjoying it. I haven't pursued a new
            sport in a while and for whatever reason this one feels right. On top of how much fun jumping is, it feels
            great to exercise with a purpose. Like now when I work out I'm going stuff to help my jumps which is nice
            cause I get to reap the rewards of my efforts by jumping higher! So that's been a lot of fun and the coach
            is great which helps a lot. He's super encouraging and has a lot of faith in me which makes me even more
            motivated. After writing this I'm going to Lowe's to get a pvc pipe for practice.<br><br>
            Now I know it's probably kinda cringe to have a little paragraph about vaulting and then a much larger
            paragraph about a video game, but ummmmm…. uhhhhhh… <br>Celeste is a very difficult and precise
            platformer, and I'm gonna give you some introduction to set the stage for this challenge I'm working on.
            So the main story of Celeste has 7 levels of increasing difficulty, and they're honestly not too bad.
            It'll be a struggle but pretty much anyone could get through these eventually. I think I spent about 8
            hours of play time on them. Upon completing the story there's an additional level 8 that gets a bit
            harder than the final level of the main story. But here's where things get interesting. Each level has a
            hidden casette tape that, if you find it, unlocks a "B-side" for that level. B sides are usually
            slightly shorter, but have a huuuge increase in difficulty. Manage to beat all of those, and you unlock
            "C-sides". C sides are very short, only having 3 rooms to complete, but they will be the most difficult
            screens in the game. So now that you understand the difficulty curve of the game and its 24 levels (8
            a-sides, b-sides, and c-sides), I can explain the 202 strawberry challenge.
            <br><br>There are 202 strawberries you can collect in the game. 175 are simple, just hidden somewhere in
            the a-sides, but usually not too hard to get, som I'm done with those. So that leaves 27, and these are
            the ones worth talking about. Once you've finish <strong>all</strong> the c-sides, a golden strawberry
            will appear at the start of each level. If you pick it up and finish the entire level without dying,
            congrats! You got a golden strawberry. Easier said than done of course since some of these levels
            regularly have people dying close to 1000 times before their first clear. So do that once for every a,
            b, and c-side, and you're at 199/202.
            <br><br>So what are the last 3 then? First one is pretty straightforward, beat the first level without
            dashing. This however requires a lot of pixel perfect jumps since you can use the most important
            mechanic in the game.
            Now, to introduce the last 2 berries, I have to talk about the actual final chapter, Farewell. <br><br>
            Chapter 9, or "Farewell", is far and away the longest and most difficult map in the game. It's actually
            not even close. There's no b or c side, just chapter 9. It features screens that regularly are at and
            even exceeding the difficulty of the hardest c side screens. But instead of 3 rooms, it's 93 *thunder
            crashing* There's one hidden berry where you complete the entire final screen of Farewell (which is by
            far the longest screen) and at the very end instead of finishing it, you have to traverse backwards and
            to a secret room that's about as hard as they get in the game. Complete that and the moon berry is
            yours. And of course, the final berry, strawberry #202... the Farewell golden. If you somehow get to
            this point, you have a task before you that will make all your previous achievements feel vanishingly
            insignificant in comparison. Complete all of Farewell without dying once, and the last berry is yours. I
            died over 3000 times completing Farewell the first time, so if I get there it'll be a while before I can
            shave that number down. Here's a table of the challenge berries I have so far:<br><br>

            So the c-sides are obviously really hard but they're super short so easier to golden that even the a-sides
            sometimes.

            <h3>The worst movie of all time</h3>
            Ok last thing. If you are at all interested in witnessing cinema <strong>history(!!!)</strong>, you have to
            have to have to go see Megalopolis. This movie has completely changes my brain, in fact it's probably still
            happening. I have no idea what I witnessed the other night, and can't make sense of it. Like you might say a
            movie is bad cause it's boring but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I pissed in the seat! I
            was cracking up pretty much the whole time, and when I woke up the next day, I didn't even believe it was
            real. It was so bizarre that I thought I dreamt it, until I realized that no dream I could have would ever
            be as feverish, confusing, and surreal as a single scene from Megalopolis.<br><br>Yes, it did suck
            Megacockolis, but it was one of the most memorable movie experiences of my life. It is ambitiously bad. It's
            worse than any other movie could ever dare to be.

        <div class="blog">
            <h2>09-30-2024: First blog</h2>

            <p>Originally this page was supposed to function as a "leaderboard" where I would publish a bunch of records
                for
                different things I've tried, but I realized that a lot of the things that I've put a lot of time into
                don't really translate to a leaderboard.
                I also wanted to talk about whatever I was currently working on in a longer format so I figured a blog
                would be the best way to accomplish this.
                <br><br>So this first blog is basically gonna be an in memorium/reflection of the different endeavors
                I've had in approximately chronological order. Each section is gonna be labeled so you can just skip to
                the ones you're interested in.
                <br><br>
            <h3>Tennis (this is the long one)</h3>
            I mean I did a bunch of different things when I was younger, but tennis is the first one that I'll "count"
            since I was still playing a lot into adulthood.
            Like I played violin for about 7 years but I was never super into it and I quit when I was like 13.<br><br>
            I started playing tennis when I was like 8, and started playing competitively when I was 10, traveling to
            tournaments. There's a lot I could talk about when it comes to playing tennis as a junior, but that's
            honestly pretty boring if you didn't do the same, so I'll just skip to when I was 18.
            <br><br>After I graduated high school I realized that I had a shot at going D1 if I really grinded tennis in
            the summer, so I started training at Raleigh Racquet Club M-F. We would play from 9am-11am, then from
            12:30-3:30pm, then I would coach from 4-6pm. I was so insanely exhausted at the end of each day since we
            were always playing in the heat of the summer, outdoors, on hard courts that get 10-15 degrees warmer than
            the forecasted temp.
            This was brutal, but at the end of it all worth it because I was able to walk on a D1 team at UNC Charlotte,
            and although I was the worst player, I was in the best shape on the team because of all the work I did that
            summer.
            <br><br>
            College was clearly gonna be an uphill battle. I went in a solid tier below the next worse person on the
            team. That's not a huge knock against me either. If I walked into pretty much any country club in the
            country I'd likely be the best/close to the best there, but 2 of the 12 people on my team were literal
            professionals, so college is a whole 'nother league.
            Regardless, I was determined to make the most of the fact that I was lucky to even be there, I looked up to
            a lot of guys on the team and I wanted to be as good as them and really earn my place.
            <br><br>So I basically just got my grindset on and was working around the clock to get better. It didn't
            help that I was an engineering major (everyone else on the team was a business major and way less busy).
            Here's a schedule I remember from first semester freshman year.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>5am wake up and get breakfast</li>
                <li>6 - 7:30am gym</li>
                <li>8 - 11am chem lab</li>
                <li>11:15 - 12:15pm chem class</li>
                <li>cram lunch</li>
                <li>1:30 - 5:15pm practice</li>
                <li>5:30-6:45pm drift in and out of consciousness in the back of calc</li>
            </ul>
            And only then can I even start on any homework or required community activities by student athletes. But I
            knew my hard work was paying off cause I was getting in even better shape and improving the whole time. In
            fact I was getting better <em><strong>faster</strong></em> each month. I was going to tournaments and having
            better results each time, beating better players and even won a tournament. Towards the end of the semester
            I even started taking set off of some of the guys on the team.
            I was even practicing some on Sunday (our day off) to try to get one step closer to the rest of the team. My
            confidence, ability, and enjoyment for the sport were on the up and up and I was super optimistic about my
            future.
            <br><br>I had, however, been dealing with a nagging hip and back pain for a few years now and finally got
            some MRIs done. In late January of my next semester, I got results back from the doctor that told my I
            needed to stop playing immediately in preparation for surgery. In fact, he said he didn't even know how I
            had been playing up to that point with such a badly damaged hip. So that earned me some brownie points with
            the coaches since they thought I was super tough, but that still meant all my progress was gonna be halted.
            At the time, this didn't seem like that huge of a deal to me. It affirmed that the pain I felt was real, and
            I figured I'd be back and better than ever after my recovery.
            <br><br>If you've ever gotten surgery or have a more functional brain than me you probably realized that
            this is a bit too optimistic. After an 8 month recovery, I came back to playing and was struggling heavily.
            I mean the technique never left, but something mentally wasn't there. I had spent such an incredible effort
            gaining so much momentum in my freshman year that I was getting increasingly discouraged that it all went
            out the window. All my 14 hour days, 7 day training weeks, skipping parties with friends, all gone to waste.
            I was struggling to feel like I belonged before, and now I was completely lost.
            I ruminated on my position, which only made my mental worse, which made the ruminating worse and so on. This
            was having a terrible effect on my tennis and rather than improving, I felt my level actively slipping. We
            had an odd number of players so I found myself hitting serves alone during practice or practicing with the
            team's racket stringer. This also came at the same time new coaches took over the program and they really
            had no clue about my situation or how much progress I was making before. It was years later that I had the
            idea that they were likely trying to get me to leave the team so they didn't have to deal with kicking me
            off. I was so incredibly proud of myself at one point, and now felt like I had failed tremendously.
            <br><br>When I finally thought about quitting it was such an easy decision. Like, of course I should quit. I
            was (not clinically) depressed all the time because my confidence was shot from failing harder each and
            every day. I'm skipping over details for the sake of brevity (look how that turned out), but all in all it
            was an amazing decision that allowed me the time and energy to explore all of the following hobbies and
            spend more time with people important to me. I also recognize that through struggle I was able to learn a
            tremendous amount about myself and how I best deal with adversity. I don't have a single regret from my
            entire time playing tennis in college.
            <h3>Running</h3>
            Something active felt like the logical next step, after I spent a lot more time rehabbing my hip and getting
            my strength back up. Running always felt incredibly relaxing, and gave me an opportunity to spend more time
            in nature. This was hardly ever a hobby that I took super seriously, I had a few 3 months stints where I'd
            run pretty heavily but I'd always get burnt out.
            I always found my joy in running through it's spontaneity and feeling of freedom, especially when I was
            trail running. If I hard schedule a training plan its now no longer either of those things.
            In 2023 I decided to turn one of my 3 month stints into training for a half marathon race where I got 9th
            with a time of 1:39:45 and haven't really run at all since then lol.
            <h3>Coding</h3>
            After I stopped playing tennis I thought I'd like learning to code and ended up being really liking it so I
            switch to comp-sci for my major and now it's my job. I used to do coding competitions on codeforces.com but
            didn't do a ton and stopped doing a bunch of harder problems for practice after I got a job. Still like it a
            lot hence this website.
            <h3>Music/Movies/Books</h3>
            I think in like late 2017 I thought that I'd feel more cultured or something if I started listening to
            albums instead of just songs. And I wanted to listen to a lot of interesting and out-there stuff, so I
            started looking around online and since then I've listened to and rated several hundred albums.
            The majority of those were in the 3 years that followed but I still like to hear new stuff when it floats my
            way, I just seek it out less ambitiously than before. I have a music reviews section on this site you
            might've seen, and I plan on adding a review of all my 9/10 and 10/10 albums there, which at the moment is
            about 50 or maybe 8ish% of the albums I've heard.
            <br><br>I also had a similar thought about books last year. I thought "how many great stories am I missing
            out on? wouldn't I feel a sense of satisfaction of experiencing the classics of another form of media?"
            Movies are another thing that I feel like I'll never run out of suggestions for, there's just always
            something you hear about that sounds worth watching.
            <br><br>I guess the summary of this section is that experiencing the great stories of the world and being
            culturally in tune is something that's important to me. And hearing what resonates with others is always
            really interesting to me too cause I think it reflects a lot about how they see themselves.
            <h3>Melee</h3>
            Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Gamecube is one of the greatest games to ever grace the collective
            fingertips of this Earth. The sheer level of passion the community has for the game may be unrivaled.
            Whenever I meet someone that's also into it, we can instantly talk for hours about it.
            I used to play tournaments for a short period of time, but stopped for interest in other things. I also
            wasn't super in to the competitive gamer grind. I'm still an avid spectator and have been since 2016.
            <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
            I had like a couple months where I climbed once a week, but I pretty much stopped cold turkey. It's fun, and
            I'd happily go again, memberships are just expensive and I didn't feel into it enough. I think I climbed a
            few V3s but that was it.
            <h3>Piano</h3>
            I don't even think this lasted 3 days lol.
            <h3>Hollow Knight</h3>
            Hollow Knight is a beautiful single player game and I recommend it if you like difficult games, or even if
            you're on the fence. The worldbuilding, storyline, music and art are all top tier.
            Anyways I played this game a good bit last year and this year too. At the end of the game, there are these
            challenges called pantheons that are basically boss rushes for a bunch of bosses in the game. There are 4 of
            them that get progressively harder.
            If you beat all 4 you unlock a secret 5th pantheon. This one blows the others out of the water. It's all 4
            of the other pantheons combined into 1 plus harder stages/variants for most bosses plus extra bosses in
            general plus at the end of all of it you have to fight a new harder version of what is essentially the
            incarnation of THE SUN, which is far and away the hardest boss in the game. If you beat all (44?) of them in
            a row you complete the hardest achievement in the game. There's also some achievements for speedrunning and
            beating everything without dying (steel soul).
            <br><br>But we can go further...<br>
            The place with the pantheons has this area called "The Hall of Gods" where you can fight every boss
            individually, and if you beat them without getting hit you get a gold symbol next to the bosses name that
            indicates you beat it on "radiant difficulty". So I grinded that and eventually got all 44 of them.
            <br><br>But we can go even further...<br>
            Back to the pantheons. Each one has 4 different bindings you can add to increase difficulty.
            <ul>
                <li>Nail binding: melee damage goes from like 30 to 13</li>
                <li>Soul binding: total soul reserves (for healing and casting spells that do damage) go from 200 to 33
                </li>
                <li>Charm binding: there are 40 charms that can give you various buffs, you can't use those anymore with
                    this one</li>
                <li>Mask binding: total health goes from 9 to 4</li>
            </ul>
            Each time you complete one of these, a seal with the binding logo appears above the specific pantheon you
            beat with whatever binding(s) were on. If you can beat all 5 pantheons with each binding on at least once,
            you get a secret room unlock and little bit of extra lore. And I completed this some time earlier this year.
            <br><br>But we can go further yet again...(last time I promise)<br>
            <strong>IF</strong> you managed to do all of that, there is one last challenge the game has for those truly
            brave. You can attempt to beat each pantheon with <strong>all bindings on at the same time!</strong>
            I was only able to do this for the first 2 before I tapped out bit I may revisit one day.
