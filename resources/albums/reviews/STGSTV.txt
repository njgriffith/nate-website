Animal Collective - Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished

In their early days, Animal Collective was experimenting with sound more so that traditional music. And it's from there that there songs began to slowly take form.
From their messy shapeless creations they would see music take form in front of them, almost as if it was itself a living being.
This is a lens that I like to view a lot of what they have made through as it feels less like their songs have been created and more like they have been born out of an abundance
or something akin to childlike wonder.
I would say if there's any theme I'm a "sucker" for, it would be coming of age stories. This is probably the best execution of this theme I have experienced, but more on that later.
The first track feels like I'm peering into another world that I'm not supposed to be able to see. And the mere sight of what I'm seeing is hurting me.
Something about the beauty resonating from this figure in front of you prevents you from averting your gaze.
I would say bittersweet has never been a better descriptor than with much of this album as you have transcendental, otherworldly 
sounds layered between piercing sounds of harsh, abrasive static.
