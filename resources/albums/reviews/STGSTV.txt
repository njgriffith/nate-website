In their early days, Animal Collective was experimenting more so with sound than traditional music. And it's from there that their songs began to slowly take form. From their messy shapeless creations they would see music take form in front of them, almost as if it was itself a living being. This is a lens through which I like to view a lot of what they have made as it feels less like their songs have been created and more like they have been born out of an abundance of something akin to childlike wonder. I would say if there's any theme I'm a "sucker" for, it would be coming of age stories. This is probably the best execution of this theme I have experienced, but more on that later. The first track feels like I'm peering into another world that I'm not supposed to be able to see. And the mere sight of what I'm seeing is hurting me. Something about the beauty resonating from this figure in front of you prevents you from averting your gaze. I would say bittersweet has never been a better descriptor than with much of this album as you have transcendental, otherworldly sounds layered between piercing sounds of harsh, abrasive static. This juxtaposition between the sweet glistening sounds and the harsh wall of static works as an allegory for the bittersweetness of childhood. Especially if you think about the fact that the harsh high pitched noises become harder to hear as you get older, so as you look back on your childhood a lot of the bitterness is washed away, and you can only hear sweet. I’m not sure if this was intentional or not, but it’s interesting at the least. This duality is pretty pervasive throughout the entirety of the album and the whole thing makes me float.
All of this leads up to “Alvin Row”, the closing track, where the album confronts all of that harshness in the most cathartic emotional explosion I have yet to hear. 
In a few words, this album is lightning in a bottle.
