REQUESTED REVIEW

I think the issue with coming out with an album as a nepo-baby, and your music very clearly has a super high production value, is that you're basically only 1 step above music made by A.I. Meaning that, I'm suspicious of the humanity and actual love for the art form the artist actually has, and wonder if they're just doing it because they can. So I do acknowledge that Gracie is starting off at a disadvantage and that I am already a little biased against her, but I don't think she ever really makes up for it.

In general I just feel a lack of a lot of substance or emotional depth on this thing. All of the lyrics and stories are very straightforward, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as I think it can work well as a stylistic choice (ex. the song "Carissa" by Sun Kil Moon). But when I hear Sun Kil Moon describe in very plain english about how his 2nd cousin from Ohio died from an aerosol can explosion while taking out the trash, I feel so much more. I understand the sense of loss and confusion, I feel the nostalgia he has for his hometown, and I even find the absurdity of it a little amusing. In short, I don't think this album has the personality to make it worthwhile.

And I think that's the crux of why I don't like this thing, personality. I mean, it sounds fine. I'm sure a lot of money went into making it sound very clean. But the result is something that feels more "sanitized" than anything. Pretty much all great music has a persona tied to it. An image of how the artist wants themselves to be perceived. After listening to this my only reaction is that Gracie doesn't really have a personality. If she does, she wasn't really able to display it in any meaningful way.
