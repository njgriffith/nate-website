If you've been following along with the Animal Collective plant analogy, this is it becomes much fuller with leaves.

"Feels" sees the band moving forward with the sound they developed on <a href="/templates/album-review.html?album=sung_tongs">Sung Tongs</a> and maturing it a little more. It's less wild, but prettier. A lot more contained and reflective. There are still some wild moments, but far more prevalent are deeply emotional passages. Banshee Beat and Loch Raven are probably the 2 best examples.
