Continuing with the Animal Collective plant analogy from the last 2 reviews, this is where the plant begins to sprout leaves and becomes much greener. This album flourishes. It's bright, dense, and lush while remaining deeply psychedelic.

I will admit that this album is kinda hit or miss, but when it hits...I could probably cherry pick to make a 5-track EP that would be an easy 10. 

Lots of amazing songs here, but Winter's Love in particular has meant more to me than almost any song I've ever heard.It's hard to explain, something about it is so incredibly comforting, like meeting yourself from another time in your life and getting reassurance. But I don't even know if that's accurate to how I feel, and to be honest, for me to understand why I like that song so much, I probably need to know a lot more about myself in the first place. Maybe more than I'll ever know, but I think that's ok.
