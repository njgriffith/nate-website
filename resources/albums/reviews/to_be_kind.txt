Swans is definately a group that makes special music. Nobody quite matches their ability to construct fully fleshed out sci-fi worlds without even explicitly stating anything. The imagery their music evokes is simply that potent. In my opinion, this is their greatest showcase of this feat. The level of deatail in which I experience the world from qhich this album was born is astounding. That being said, as I discuss the album I'll be refencing the story as I see it told throught the music.

From the first note in Screen shot you can already sense something sinister in the air. With each loop the track grows, almost in a way that is meant to subvert the listener, sneaking in new disorienting sounds one after another. 
This track sees the Sun rise over a wasted landscape. The world is barren, but not devoid of life, rather devoid of any sense of morals, good-will, or civility.
Something Swans has made a trademark of theirs is the ability to slowly build a song until it has enough momentum to obliterate anything in its path. This track is a perfect example of this for the uninitiated.
The track continue to pile on to the central rhythm until it reaches critical mass and unfurls into a ball of white hot noise. The heat from the Sun becomes unignorable as it reaches a high point in the sky and all of the world and it's sin, decay, and unforgivingness are available for all to see.

The second track begins with a slow, disorienting, arcing sound. Something like watching waves of heat rise off desert grounds in the distance. And its in that desert we see a lone traveler dragging their dead and rotten body through the sand, clinging to the last semblance of life.
The bass line is steady and hypnotic. They exist in a daze watching the vultures circle the infernal Sun. Their disorientation eventually turns to manic delusions. 

"I'm just a little boy". "I need love".

Laugher echoes in their head. They cry out in response.

"I'm not a human!"

Their humanity has been stripped from them by this unforgiving world. The gods of this world continue to torment his mind rather than claiming him, forcing him to prolong is tortuous voyage across the sands.

As I mention "gods" I feel the next track "A Little God In My Hands" serves as a deeper look into the theistic nature of this work. The people of this world worship many different gods, all have a brutal and unforgiving disposition.
This song observes a sacraficial ritual of the people. They too are brutal, much like the world they live in. Their settlements lay in rotten flith, and reek of rot.
Much like the traveler in the sands, their minds have unraveled noticably. The base levels of sanity are unrecognizable from the distant viewpoint of civility.
Their minds are decayed to the core as represented by the peircing static present in the many climaxes of this track.

Up to now, the album's tracks have served mostly as exposition, displaying the world in vivid, feverish detail.
"Bring the Sun", however, is the first song that explores the plot of this album on a deeper level. The song begins quiet. In space above this world we can see a distant shimmering light. In an instant we zoom in and are face to face with the roaring inferno of a comet. Something about the comet feels alive, it appears to move with knowledge of it's purpose, of it's destination.
The repeating guitar riff roars with the heat of the blaze. The light blinding, and only increasing in intensity. Unknown to the world below, this conveyer of death is hurdling towards them with a purpose.
As the riff fades, our perspective shifts back to the planet as we see cultish figures in robes casting their hands to the sky. Surrounded by alien gliphs sprawled in black ink, they are focused intently on a sole speaker chanting indecipherable vocations into the air, thick with smoke and the stench of blood.
The speaker continues to chant, the dedicated focus of the cult members unbroken. The cadence of the chanting begins to rise, eventually calling upon the other members to join in.
The strength of their ritual reaches new heights. They all speak in unison:

"Sunnnnnnnnnnn"

"Bring the Sun!" the leader calls in response. Some of the gliphs on the ground begin to glow a deep red and the leading speaker is seen slighly levitating from where he stands.
The room begins to shake, lightly and then violently as the group continues. Until the whole act reaches a climax and the room plunges into darkness and the members involuntarily drop to the floor and lay as anonymous bodies in an empty room.
From the perspective of all those
