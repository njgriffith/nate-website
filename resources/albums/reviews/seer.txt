I was able to find this thing I wrote a while ago about the beginning of this album.

The moon hung starkly in the great dome of a sky. A black sky coalesced with a forest in the distance blacker still, and a vast emptiness spread before them like a promise unfulfilled. The hot air hung with a heavy sense of contempt and disgust for the world it held, so rich it clung to the skin of those present.

The world had long since gone mad. A wedge had been driven between the bleeding heart of the masses, and resulted in the total abandonment of any sense of kinship. They met on that night to rid the world of its malignant poison. They were all certain that very poison flowed within them, but that hardly made a difference. Voiceless lightning split the distant sky. 

In the foyer of an old forgotten home, the group of obscured faces met around a dimly glowing fissure of the earth. One such face stepped into the starlight that fell from one of many gashes in the ceiling of that forsaken home. The light illuminated a noseless face that had been badly burned. An arm reached forward.

Outside, the night lay quiet, soon to be disturbed. The voices from inside that structure obscured by a hurried river and the noise from anonymous creatures in the night. In a moment, the structure is set ablaze. A deep red light pierces the sky, followed by and incredible noise, then a deep silence.

A terrifying presence has entered this world.
