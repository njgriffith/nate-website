I'm just gonna paste this message from a DM where I was talking about the song "Ween Wao" to a friend

Tek Lintowe is a generational artist who is a pure reflection of gen z and the generation of being raised on the internet. He is so incredibly coated in irony that a passing listener wouldn't see the deep passion he has for his craft, to see how creative he really is. Like many people his age, Tek Lintowe presents himself first through irony, hiding his true feeling under layers of sarcasm. Perhaps as a defense mechanism? Or by fear of being ridiculed for being vulnerable. Either way, he has a message to get put there, and he seems to be internally conflicted. Ween Wao is the perfect representation of him as an artist and is rightfully his most popular song even if it objectively ass.
