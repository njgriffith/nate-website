This album is so incredibly catchy and packed to the brim with personality. It’s witty, funny, and over before you realize. It definitely borders on “omg I’m so quirky, look at me” at times, but that’s honestly just a result of AJJ putting so much of their personality in it which I admire a lot. The result is just tons of fun.
