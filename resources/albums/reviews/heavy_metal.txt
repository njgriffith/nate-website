I was sick when I found this album.
I laid on the couch to rest and felt the warmth of the sunlight healing me. But then I felt another kind of warmth...

i peepeed myself

But then I felt yet another warmth, and it was the sweet voice of this man spooning chicken soup into my sick mouth.
Thank you Cameron.

Adding more to this since this album is amazing and deserves more.

There are so many incredible moments that so accurately convey complex emotion through music, more so that words alone ever could. Like on the song "Drinking Age" around 1:20. The song gently arrives to a moment of serene solitude...
What follows is the unmistakable sound of a heart grieving. A heavy resigned exhale that sounds equal parts depressing and comforting.

I also found the story on "Cancer of the Skull" particularly moving. 
The song follows a musician who is afflicted with cancer on his fingers.
The chorus goes:

"Oh, cancеr of the fingers
And the hands of a beginner"

The anguish of losing your ability when you are so young, with energy, passion and determination. The feeling of your youth being robbed from you.

The arthritis on my spine feels the same way, albeit far less aggressively debilitating, but the feeling of slowly losing the battle to be able to do the things that bring you joy is a difficult reality to wrestle with. The knowledge that it will only get worse hangs heavy on my conscience and I imagine the feeling of this song's main character is similar.

I really just can't stop listening to this thing, one of the best albums I've heard so far this decade.
