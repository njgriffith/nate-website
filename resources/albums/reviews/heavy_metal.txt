I was sick when I found this album.
I laid on the couch to rest and felt the warmth of the sunlight healing me. But then I felt another kind of warmth...

i peepeed myself

But then I felt yet another warmth, and it was the sweet voice of this man spooning chicken soup into my sick mouth.
Thank you Cameron.
