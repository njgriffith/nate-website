This album in many ways feels very much like watching a play. The theatrical delivery and bright, upbeat tempos make it seem like a musical number on a broadway show. In the best way possible it's theatre kid music. And this isn't to say the instrumentation feels cheap or unoriginal as the genuine passion felt from each band member throughout the record is honestly wonderfully captivating. Not to mention the vocal performances from Isaac Wood which are the perfect accompaniment to the band's style. If you do find yourself listening to this album you will surely be rewarded by the time you get to the final track, Basketball Shoes. This almost 13 minute epic combines everything great about this album into one song. There are quiet, thoughtful moments that slowly build to set the stage for Isaac to tell stories that always feel so real and personal, yet not about him at all. The instrumental participation and lyrical illustrations are picture perfect. Though where this song shines in particular is the last half where the remaining 6 minutes are used to build up one of the most cathartic emotional payoffs I have ever heard. The delivery of these final moments never fails to give me chills and leave my jaw wide open. 

Ants From Up There is an instant classic from a group of fantastic songwriters that will surely go down as on of the best albums of this decade.
