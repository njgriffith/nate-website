Golden Drugs are my personal proof that you will never exhaust all of the great albums out there. They have like 300 monthly Spotify listeners and have been one of my favorite bands since I discovered them about 5 years ago. This album was my introduction to them during my freshman year and college and something about it felt so deeply personal, like someone hand delivered this to me. I feel comforted yet propelled in the most extraordinary way when I hear these tracks. I might even consider the first 4 tracks my personal favorite 4-track run. Unfortunately I think the end is slightly weak, especially for an album of this caliber. That’s not to say they aren’t <em>good</em>; but they had amazing endings on their other 2 projects, so knowing what this group is capable of ever so slightly sours how I feel about this. That aside, this is easily one of the best albums I have ever heard, it absolutely envelops me for like 80-90% of the time.
