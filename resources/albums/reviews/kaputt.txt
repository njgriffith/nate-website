You'd be surprised based on the name "Destroyer", but this is a very soft, relaxing, and poetic collection of music. This is definitely one of my comfort albums. So easy to listen to and leaves you feeling refreshed afterwards. "Bay of Pigs" in particular works absolutely perfect as a closer, it's so serene.
