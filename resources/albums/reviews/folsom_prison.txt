Growing up one of my best friend's dad was the drummer for a Johnny Cash cover band. I can still remember how the 2 of them talked about this album. I finally got around to listening to it after my dad lent me his copy of the vinyl, and wow.

Are you a fan of the scene is Shawshank Redemption where Andy locks himself in the Warden's office and blasts opera over the prison speakers, the scene where for a moment all of the prisoners felt freedom for a fleeting moment?
Then listen to this.
Hearing the crows adds so much to this. You can almost see the smiles on their faces as the hoot and yell. I'm imagining people sitting on the floors of the upper floor of cells. Legs hanging off the walkway and arms clutching the bars. Of course that's not how it actually looked, they took pictures. Nonetheless it paints an amazing picture of a breath of humanity swept through an otherwise depressing location.

"It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away"
