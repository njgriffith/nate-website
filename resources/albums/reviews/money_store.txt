It STILL sounds cutting edge in the year of our lord TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR!!!
Unfathomable that this was made in 2012.

This was basically THE bleeding edge of hyper-modern dystopian internet music. Songs like "Blackjack" sound exactly like the fear of going on the dark web, finding something you shouldn't have, and then seeing your name and address in the website's chat logs.

Seeing them live and watching them paly their absolute hearts out until Zach Hill (drummer) puked was something I'll never forget.
