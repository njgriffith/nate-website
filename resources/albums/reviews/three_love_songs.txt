There’s kind of a strange nostalgia that comes from albums like these. Something about the sounds on this album elicit a sort of “coming-of-age” atmosphere. I had just finished watching “Adventure Time” all the way through for the first time since childhood and I felt like the timing for that was perfect. The sounds on here perfectly parallel a whimsical, fantastical world on that same childlike wonder that makes things like “Adventure Time” or “Spirited Away” so amazing.

There are also songs with profound levels of emotional tension like “In Rural Virginia” and “I Can Hear the Heart Breaking As One” which balance the other sweet, playful tracks with some heartbreaking bitterness so nicely. There are a couple forgettable tracks on here, but at its best, the emotions on this are effortlessly monumental, like being swept away by a great wind. For some reason I am particularly affected by “Starting Over”. It’s probably a top 3 comfort song of all time for me. And I can see in my head so vividly the world restarting when it plays. Cells dividing, plants sprouting, the sun rising. I can’t tell you how many times I”ve put this song on just to watch the grass blow in the wind.
