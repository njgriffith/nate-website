In the 3 years following making perhaps my favorite album of all time <a href="/templates/album-review.html?album=STGSTV">Spirit They’re Gone, Spirit They’ve Vanished</a>, AnCo would go on to release 2 more albums. The first of which "Danse Manatee" stayed more in the realm of the "coming of age" theme. Despite that album being massively underrated imo, I do find it to be a bit loosely put together.

Ark on the other hand is incredibly thematically consistent, creative in the way that you'll never hear another band make a song quite like this, and also sees the band take a slight step away from themes surrounding coming of age, choosing to focus more energy intro producing incredibly potent psychedelic music.

At the risk of using a word that Joe Rogan loves to use, AnCo sounds their most primal here. Something about this album is prehistoric, like I'm experiencing some deep seeded memories that have been in my DNA for hundreds of millions of years. And it almost feels like AnCo are the only people who have figured out how to communicate this, like their own language. Something about their early music really makes me feel like I'm watching myself exist from a completely new perspective, like a new set of eyes that once belonged to me but now can only be used to catch fleeting glimpses.

I talked in my STGSTV review about how their music feels like it was "discovered" rather than something strictly man-made. I sometimes like to think of their music as a plant, where STGSTV is the first hatching of the seed, and Ark is the stem first sprouting into the light.

I recognize that so far I pretty much haven't talked about the music. And well, to me, explaining the music of AnCo in their prime (2000-2009) is kind of like explaining color to a blind person. Your best bet is to try to make use of metaphors however complicated or nonsensical they may seem. Because their early music is truly something altogether unique as it is fascinating.
