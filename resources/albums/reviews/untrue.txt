If I told you this is a dubstep album you'd never listen to it. That's ‘cause the US totally gentrified it and ruined the perception of the genre forever. If you go back to the turn of the 21st century and listen to the underground dubstep scene, you’ll scarcely recognize the sound that’s associated with it today. It’s a sound made up of a cold atmosphere, echoing rhythms, and rattling bass. A lot of it sounds like it was made on another planet. 

Around 2005 dubstep's primo virtuoso “Burial” started releasing music. He’s basically their Mozart, and he brought everything great about the genre together and perfected it on “Untrue”. If you wanna hear more about the genre, Burial, and how the genre turned to shit in the 2010s, there’s a really great video about it <a href"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dhLlVVKRwk0" target="_blank" style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;">here.</a>
