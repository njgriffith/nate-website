Although this is certainly not one of Hecker’s more appraised works, something about it struck a chord with me. Tim Hecker is a master of using texture to create his ambient landscapes. And this landscape is monumental to say the least. There are so many moments that feel cataclysmic, like bearing witness to a cosmic event. “Music of the Air” sounds like amps the size of buildings are being booted up before portals to another dimension open and we can hear the sounds from another world.
