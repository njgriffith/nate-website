Sometimes this really does feel like <strong>the</strong> classic rock album. So that being said there's not really much to say that hasn't been said already. But wow this thing is amazing. The Tolkien influence is probably the cherry on top for me, made for such a unique foresty vibe on this album, especially on "Battle of Evermore". Also songs don't really get much more epic that "Stairway to Heaven" even as overplayed as it is.
