I'm just gonna pass on reviewing this cause honestly who needs to be told Abbey Road is good? It would like me telling you how great of a movie Shawshank Redemption is, anything worth saying has already been said and you've probably heard it a million different ways. If you haven't, listen to it. It's good. Also watch Shawshank.
