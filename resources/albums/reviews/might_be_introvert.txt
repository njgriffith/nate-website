I had listened to some stuff from Little Simz before this came out and I thought it was good but it wasn’t anything that really stood out to me. “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” totally changed how I saw her. This is such a beautiful sounding and well produced album. She’s ain a hugely male dominated space and manages to address it and navigate through it in a way that doesn’t feel canned or contrived. Great artists present a lot of themselves and this feels so personal in such an engaging way. I strive to ever appear this cool.
