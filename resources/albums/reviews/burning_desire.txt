I’m so glad MIKE keeps getting better. Burning Desire is his best work to date. So many interesting samples, beats, and flows on here. So many tracks here are groovy and a few get pretty personally reflective and emotional like “plz don’t cut my wings”. In this and many other tracks you can really hear MIKE bleeding through his pen. He’s got a great ability to transfer his emotional state to music. At the time of writing this, it’s probably my AOTY for 2023.
