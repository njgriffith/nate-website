This is just simply one of the coolest rap albums I've ever heard and I'm sure it's gonna continue to grow on me.

The song "Outside" sounds king of like a rap battle to me. The song opens with the tail end of another persons cypher that gets the crowd electric with his last couple bars.

Then this super deep voice comes to respond. The words seem nonsensical at first leaving most everyone confused, but as the cypher goes on everyone slowly becomes hypnotized with every word and falls into a daze. It's then revealed that this is a god making an appearance in a random rap battle on a seemingly innocuous Saturday night. 

As his words come to an end with about 2:45 left in the song, he disappears from sight and leaves everyone there in a fugue state.
