I still definitely consider <a href="/templates/album-review.html?album=lonesome_crowded_west">The Lonesome Crowded West<a> to be their best, but god damn the vibe on this album is hard to match. Something feels so lonely. All the instrumentation is super stripped back which makes for a super expansive and unique soundscape.
