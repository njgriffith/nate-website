At the risk of sounding incredibly annoying, “Person Pitch” sounds exactly like how it felt when I used to do acid. Super bright, colorful, psychedelic, and overall fun. At the time of writing this, “Bros” is probably in my top 5 songs of all time. And it’s a great portrayal of what makes the rest of the album so wonderful. It’s lush, god is it lush, and it envelops you in an unmistakable warmness that feels so familiar it’s like you’re being held by yourself. Amazing experience.
