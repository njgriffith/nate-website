I could talk at length about every way that this album is a masterpiece, but it’s probably the most talked about record of the last 10 years and I doubt I’d have any new insight. I’ll just say that everything is top notch, the production, sampling, features, the lyrics, the PLOT??! This is arguably the most well crafted piece of music from a purely literary standpoint the world has ever seen. And it just so happens to sound amazing too. If you haven’t heard this yet then you’re officially living under a rock.
