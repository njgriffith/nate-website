“Divine Music From a Jail” is an absolute gem of a find, and a release shrouded in a lot of mystery. It’s unclear if any of this was recorded from a jail, or who Oidupaa really is. However, the music itself is breathtaking, passionate, and freeing, which, given the title, is a testament to human triumph. At first glance, you might think this is a solo album, but Ouin breathes life into his accordion to the point where I consider this a duet. Oh to float down the Volga river on a raft, looking at the trees, birds, sky, and landscape all pass by while this plays.
