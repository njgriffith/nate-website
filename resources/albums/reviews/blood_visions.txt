I still remember the summer after my senior year of high school I was on a big streak of listening to punk music, and although I found a lot of music thoroughly enjoyed, I hadn't been able to find one that perfectly scratched the itch I was looking for. That was until I found this album.
The album is energetic, at times messy, and packed TO THE BRIM with incredible garage-punk songs. This album is just under 30 minutes long, and with 15 total tracks you can blink and it'll be over. Each track maintains the same level of angsty 90s high schooler energy as the last.

If you are at all a fan of punk music, or even the aesthetic of this period in history, 
this album can be a perfect little time capsule for you to get lost in that world for half an hour.
I can't recommend it enough.
