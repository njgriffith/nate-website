This might be my go to "lock tf in" album. There's something incredibly awe inspiring about these massive sounds, shifting, warping, burning, contrasting with the delicacy of a piano. It's something like a piercing calm amidst a raging storm. Having to think about it now since I'm writing this, that's probably why it helps me focus, because I'm basically hearing the world end around me, but the music endures through it all.

Also, I love how "Live Room Out" is basically the exhale to the massive inhale that is "Live Room". It makes so much sense that the music would have to rest after that insane performance of massive sounds.

I love when it feels like music is alive
