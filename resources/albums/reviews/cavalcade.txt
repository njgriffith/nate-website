Black Midi was incredibly hyped up before their first album, and they delivered. Two years later and they only eclipsed their own talent by releasing “Cavalcade”. Their sound has become brighter, punchier, and fuller with the addition of new sounds. You can also hear their vocals and songwriting abilities enhanced. 

“John L” is a prime example of Black Midi’s ability to develop feverish narratives with McCarthian level characters. I like to think John L (pronounced John 50) is a man who killed 50 men with 50 different guns and he’s just an agent of chaos wherever he goes. 

Black Midi is one of the only bands talented enough to make music this hectic feel entirely intentional.
