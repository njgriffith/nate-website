<p style="color: #8ACE00;">brat just feels like an enhanced version of what Charli started with “How I’m Feeling Now”. Every song here is so catchy and incredibly stylized. Charli also gets pretty personal on some tracks and they landed incredibly well. Especially “So I”, rip Sophie.

This really shows what Charli is capable of, especially when she’s more daring with her sound. I’ve def had enough of brat summer for now but this album will always be great and will certainly be a landmark for music in the 2020s.</p>
