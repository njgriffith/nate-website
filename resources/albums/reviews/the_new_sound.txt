After black midi silently broke up I was worried I would never hear the same unique sound the band had created in their short career. Thankfully, the band’s frontman Geordie Greep is continuing to push their sound further. Something notable is as the band evolved, their sound became fuller, less sharp and more well rounded. A denser and more lush instrumentation has become the most notable change as the band continued to improve. Greep once again reaches new heights here, releasing his best album to date. It’s a beautiful blend of genres and feverishly detailed stories, a lot of which get really personal on this album. It feels like he wanted to put a lot of himself in this story. That said, I’d say he talks about cum a couple more times than I’d like, but the rest of the album makes that easily forgivable. 

Especially the last 3 tracks which is absolutely one of the best album-ending runs I’ve ever heard. There’s such a pure confession of love present on these it’s impossible not to get swept away as the album builds to its climax “The Magician”, a 12 minute epic of romance, bitterness, regret, longing, and so much more. It’s a love story so real and approachable it makes you want to love more deeply in your own life. It's not often you get to hear something this striking, and it’s albums like this that, when they do come around, deepen your appreciation for not just all the great art in your life, but the people that allow you to experience such strong emotions so that you can resonate with those great works of art. Life imitates art and it’s a privilege.
