I was never as onboard as some people are with Pink Floyd. I mean, don't get me wrong I like them, but not on the level of their widespread acclaim. But after listening to Animals for the first time a few months ago I can say that this one actually lived up to the hype. Maybe this'll be that album for me that makes me want to revisit an artist's catalog.

Overall a great album, the animal theme is super cool and unique and gets used really well. Albums like this stand the test of time cause they execute a unique and creative idea in a way that really can't be replicated. I'd say dogs is a highlight but really the whole thing is great.
