“Who are you?”

Lil Ugly Mane wasn’t always known for his emotional, psychedelic/indie music, he used to make a lot of hardcore Memphis-style rap. In one of the all-time genre switch successes, he released “Volcanic Bird Enemy”. 

So much of this just feels like a dream, the sounds are all so surreal and impressively unique. I genuinely think the instrumental of “hostage master” is one of the most creative that I’ve ever heard. LUM presents so much of himself on this album, it’s such a mesmerizingly personal and immersive story.
