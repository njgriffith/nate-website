If I could use a time machine to experience <strong><em>one</em></strong> singular event from the past. I would go back to the mid-90s, get super into Fishmans, fall in love with their discography, especially “Long Season” when that comes out. Then I would hear about their final concert planned for December 28, 1998, and immediately get a flight and a ticket to experience the greatest live show ever performed, watch them play all their greatest hits, and close it with an even better version of “Long Season” that would positively have me in tears. 

I would say without exaggeration that this version of “Long Season” is probably my favorite song ever. 41 minutes of absolute magic. Although that’s definitely the high point of the show, I shouldn't let it distract from how amazing the energy, production, and overall atmosphere of every other song. You can hear just how much they wanted to nail this and they did in a major way.
