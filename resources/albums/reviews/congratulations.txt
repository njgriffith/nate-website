MGMT - Congratulations

I really wish I had more to say about this album. After all it's one of 3 that I could consider my favorite album ever made.
The truth is something about it just perfectly resonates with me, like there's a Congratulations sized hole in my brain that nothing else could fit.
Every song is absolutely to die for. It's bright, fun, catchy, full of winding passages and entrancing songwriting.
I woudn't choose to omit a single second of the record, but if I could shine a spotlight on one song in particular it would be Siberian Breaks.
The 12 minute epic is full of several movements that could be standout songs on their own, 
but together they dance around each other and take turns steering this song through space destination nowhere and we are lucky enough to be able watch.
And that pretty much sums of my feelings on the rest of the project as a whole. In my eyes this is unequivocally a perfect albums cover to cover
