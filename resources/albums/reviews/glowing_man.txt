To a lot of people, <a href="/templates/album-review.html?album=seer">The Seer</a> represents hell or the devil, or maybe some other representation of pure contempt. While the following album <a href="/templates/album-review.html?album=to_be_kind">To Be Kind</a> represents man and all his folly and unflappable determination to conquer.

Then the trilogy is ended here with The Glowing Man, representing god or some ascended man. And this album lives up the the duty of capping off one of the greatest trilogies in media history. It's all-consumingly ethereal while maintaining the classic Swans tension and terror. This is god-fearin' country.

I remember listening to the opener "Cloud of Forgetting" while walking around an empty field. The tree trunks grew to massive redwoods in front of me, a small creek became a vast canyon lines with rocks that had now become massive boulders. I think the ability of Swans to evoke such visceral and seemingly real images into your head is something that has always amazed me.
