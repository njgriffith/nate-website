This feels like I've infiltrated an alcoholic and deranged clown's dream to try and help him kick his addiction and come back to normalcy. The whole thing is just plain odd and disorienting. I imagine in the dream I have to navigate a nightmarish carnival in the constructs of the clown's mind. There’s other clowns and carnival objects come to life trying to stop me from getting to the dreamer. The further this album goes, the more you learn about the dreamer and the closer they get to snapping back to reality. In “Part Three” you finally break through the hard ego of the clown and by the end of the album he finds himself again in a moment of extraordinary triumph.

One of the best qualities music can have is uniquity. “Not Available” has that in spades and it’s a fantastic listen as well.
