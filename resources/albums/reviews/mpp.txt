If you've been following along with the Animal Collective plant analogy, this is the plant finally blooming.

Merriweather Post Pavilion is AnCo's biggest commercial success by a good bit. It's their most polished record while staying true to their psychedelic roots. This is probably where new AnCo listeners should go. Some of my favorite songs of theirs are on here, even if the album as a whole isn't my favorite of theirs, but that bar is set on top of Mt. Everest.

This albums also caps off what is, in my opinion, the greatest decade run of any artist in history
