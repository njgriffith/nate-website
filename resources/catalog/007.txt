<strong>Creature 007</strong> found in the archipelagos between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is the most empirically dangerous of the observed specimens. It assumes the form of an object or setting meant to lure a vulnerable subject into a false sense of security. Typically targets children.

Seen above, Creature 007 assumed the form of a playground when presented a young child during tests. Has successfully consumed 2 victims before capture and one since, after which security measures were heightened greatly.
