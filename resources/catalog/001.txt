<strong>Creature 001 </strong> was first observed in a lab in Turkey, believed to have originated from the moon of Jupiter "Io". Reacts strongly to all noble gasses except Helium, although it is unclear if this strong reaction is a positive or a negative one.
Typically lays dormant until the moon is at it's perigee, then becomes it's most active.

Creature does not appear to be hostile but must be handled with care due to it's impressively strong bone structure. The leading theory is that this creature is originally from Jupiter and the high gravity has strengthened it's structure. Given the suspected origin, this would mean that this species has managed to colonize a moon (or several moons) of it's home planet. Could it be more advanced than us?
