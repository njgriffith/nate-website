<strong>Creature 006</strong> was found in the deserts of Namibia making a series of non-random marks in the sand. It appears to understand language based on its responses, but they are very limited.

Believed to be an artificial lifeform created by another species and sent to Earth with a purpose. Perhaps to collect information? Or something else?

Its purpose is still the subject of great speculation.
